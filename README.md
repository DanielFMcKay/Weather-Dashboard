# Weather-Dashboard

Overview: a weather app for displaying current weather and five day forecasts that saves and reloads cities the user inputs

# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Note: this is still in progress and will be updated.

This app is for the week 06 assignment for the UC Berkeley coding boot camp through Boot Camp Spot.

* This weather page will take a city name, and return a forecast with the temperature, wind speed, UV index, humidty, and current date, as well as a weather icon for the type of weather.

* It does this by contacting OpenWeatherMap.org through an API call to retrieve the information.

* It also shows the current day, date, and time on the top of the page beneath the header.

* The parameters for the app also include a five-day forecast. So far there is a one-day forecast /!\This will be completed later/!\

* Also, when a city is requested, a button is appended beneath the search field that is both part of the search history, and can be used to call up a forecast for that city again later.

* Finally, the button persists in local storage, so it reloads when the page does.
